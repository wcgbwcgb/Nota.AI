# Lecture Structure & Course Overview

## 1. Executive Summary
This lecture introduces the conceptual framework for a two-semester course sequence. The first semester will focus on foundational biological formalization, covering development, genetics, and their connections to individual biology and heritage. The second semester will expand into broader topics including human evolution ("baking"), disease (cancer), and human migration patterns. The overarching theme traces biological processes across temporal scales—from cellular events to evolutionary history.

## 2. Core Taxonomy
- **First Semester Focus**: Formalization, Development, Genetics
- **Second Semester Focus**: Evolution, Disease (Cancer), Human Migration
- **Temporal Scope**: Cellular/developmental time → Individual lifespan → Evolutionary/heritage time
- **Central Analogy**: Course structure mirrors "the time of your life" from microscopic beginnings to species-level history

## 3. Formalisms / Key Quotes
> "We're starting our formalization... we're going to talk about development and then... genetics."
>
> "The second semester is kind of into... evolution, we'll talk about baking and cancer, and migration of humans across the planet."
>
> "It kind of goes through like the time of your life."

## 4. Review & Action Items
- **Key Takeaway**: Course organized as progressive exploration of biological scales
- **Structural Note**: First semester = foundation; second semester = application/expansion
- **Preparation**: Anticipate connections between genetic mechanisms and larger evolutionary patterns
- **Conceptual Bridge**: Heritage serves as link between individual genetics and population migration
